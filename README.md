Hello! My name is Nicole Hambrick! ðŸ˜Š I created this website to help users on their search to find suitable GIFs for a multitude of needs. The simpilicity of the design is purposeful to help maintain and emphasize ease of use. For the build, there is a main homepage, about page and contact section in order to reach out if users have any questions or concerns. Technologies used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SCSS.

Thinking ahead to the future, there are always ways to better a site design and master useability. I would hope to continue learning more JavaScript, maximize the design using CSS and build more pages to give the site a more robust feel based on what customers need. ðŸ’»
